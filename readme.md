<strong>V 1.2.1 - Stuff under development</strong>

small note to myself: fix scrollbar showing up where it shouldnt in chrome & edge


<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I am adding sorting based on the date of the task but I am having a little bit of trouble</li>
  <li>Also made the page scrollable and not fixed height because it was a stupid idea to do otherwise and yet I still did it for some reason </li>
</ul>
<p>This project was made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a simple to do list that has the stages: to do, on going and done.</p>
